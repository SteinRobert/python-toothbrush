python-toothbrush is a package that provides a simple interface to connect
to electric toothbrushes via Bluetooth.

## Why is there no code?

The project was started in Aug 2020. 
This repository reflects the current state of development. 
Any results, insights or issues will be gathered here.
As soon as we have enough information about a certain toothbrush it will be implemented.

## Toothbrush overview

The Bluetooth protocol of every electric toothbrush may differ from any other. Therefore
every toothbrush integration needs to be thoroughly documented before it is implemented.
